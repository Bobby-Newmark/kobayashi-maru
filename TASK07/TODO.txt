Instructions

Nomad (https://www.nomadproject.io/) is used in our environment for orchestrating and scheduling our Docker container-based services. Using your configuration management framework of choice, install and configure node-2.vagrant and node-3.vagrant as Nomad agents.

Once the Nomad agents have been started and have registered with the Nomad server, they should appear in the Consul web UI and be discoverable with service discovery.
