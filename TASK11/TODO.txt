Instructions

Let's flex those muscles! For this task you will need to build your own custom container running a basic Flask web application. Awesome!
•Write a basic Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/) web application that connects and uses the Redis instance that you deployed in the previous task.
•The application can be super-basic, for example it can store an integer in Redis which is incremented and displayed each time the application is used.
•Once your application is working, containerise it and publish it to the Docker Hub. This is required when deploying it to your microservice environment.
•Create a Nomad job to deploy your application to the microservice environment.
