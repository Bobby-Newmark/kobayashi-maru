     [RESULT]
	Current machine states:

	node-1.vagrant            running (virtualbox)

	The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
	shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
	suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
	simply run `vagrant up`.
