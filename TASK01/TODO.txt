Instructions
•Using Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/) and VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/), deploy 3 CentOS-7 Virtual Machines.
•Setup a Class-C private network on the 192.168.50.0 subnet.
•Use the following FQDNs and IP address for each node:
•node-1.vagrant : 192.168.50.10
•node-2.vagrant : 192.168.50.11
•node-3.vagrant : 192.168.50.12

Expectations

Executing a vagrant up should result in all three virtual machines running, and reachable from your host (workstation).
